Create K number of objects, with x y and z coordinates;

Generate coordinates and assign to the objects, that are now points in space, or cluster centroids;

Loop trough all the items in space and use equation (1) to assign them to the closest centroid;

Loop through all the centroids and divide their coordinates with K, the number of centroids.
  Use a while loop 
    In the same loop we add another loop to square the distance within each cluster, equation (2). 
    Check the sum after every operation and once it is below a threshold, break the while loop (or 
    loop trough 4 times max);
